## The Majesty of Cats

Cats, the enigmatic rulers of the internet and our homes. This post celebrates these fascinating creatures while showcasing some of the content types you can embed in your blog posts.

## Visual Delight: A Cat Picture

Images are crucial for engaging content. Here's a picture of a cat, rendered using standard Markdown:

## Code Snippets

Sometimes you need to share code. MDX handles code blocks beautifully, complete with syntax highlighting (if configured). Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greetCat(name) {
  if (!name) {
    return "Hello, mysterious feline!";
  }
  return `Hello, ${name}! Time for a nap?`;
}

console.log(greetCat("Whiskers"));
console.log(greetCat());
```

## Embedded Video Content

Videos can bring your posts to life. Here's an embedded YouTube video about cats:

## Social Media Integration

Embedding tweets can add context or social proof. Here's an embedded tweet about cats:

## Wise Words (Quote Block)

Quotes can emphasize key points or add external perspectives.

> "Time spent with cats is never wasted."
> â€” Sigmund Freud (attributed)

## Callouts and Notes

While standard Markdown doesn't have specific "callout" syntax like some platforms, you can often achieve a similar effect using blockquotes with emphasis or custom CSS styling.

> **Important Note:** Always ensure your cat has fresh water and a clean litter box. Their comfort is paramount!

This post demonstrates just a few ways to enrich your content using MDX. Experiment and see what works best for your audience!
